TO: Engineering & Product Leadership
DATE: 2025-01-15
SUBJECT: Strategic Pivot to AI-First Customer Support (Project: "NeuralSupport")

Objective:
By Q3 2025, Vertex Dynamics must launch "NeuralSupport," a Generative AI module capable of automating 40% of our client's tier-1 support tickets.

Key Requirements:
1. Transition our core legacy Java monolith to microservices that can interface with LLMs.
2. Build a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline using Python and LangChain.
3. Ensure all engineers have functional literacy in AI capability (Prompt Engineering, Basic Python).

Constraint:
Hiring freeze is in effect. We must achieve this via internal mobility and upskilling.
Target ROI: Upskilling cost must not exceed 20% of external hiring cost.
