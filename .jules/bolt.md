## 2024-12-18 - Optimized AgentCard Re-renders
**Learning:**  When passing callbacks that operate on a specific item in a list (like `onUpdate(id, data)`), avoid creating inline arrow functions in the parent's `render` loop (e.g., `onUpdate={() => update(id)}`). This breaks reference equality and defeats `React.memo` optimization in the child.
**Action:** Define the callback in the parent to accept the ID as a first argument (e.g., `const handleUpdate = useCallback((id, data) => ..., [])`), and pass this stable function reference directly to the child. The child should then be responsible for passing its own ID when invoking the callback. This pattern ensures `props.onUpdate` remains referentially stable, allowing `React.memo` to effectively prevent unnecessary re-renders.
